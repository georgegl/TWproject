In Africa, nearly half of those deaths are from diarrheal diseases.
Population forecasts suggest that an additional 632 million people will need to gain access to improved sources to meet the Millennium Development Goal drinking water target. Accelerated progress is needed in sub-Saharan Africa, home to 37% of those without improved drinking water sources.</td><td>2</td><td>50000</td></tr><tr> <td>3</td> <td>We want to see Trump's tax returns.
</td> <td>anonymous</td> <td>President Trump calls reports of his alleged compromising ties to Russian businesses and government officials, “FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT.” He can prove it by releasing his tax returns. Who does our president owe money to? Can they use his debt to manipulate our Commander-in-Chief? Is he receiving income from foreign sources to his businesses from which he has yet to divest? The answers are easy to discover if he releases his tax returns.</td><td>0</td><td>100000</td></tr><tr> <td>4</td> <td>Put a veggie burger on the menu at In-N-Out!
</td> <td>George Huzum</td> <td>If you want a meat-free meal at In-N-Out, you’re going to be stuck eating multiple orders of French fries or a cheese-slathered bun. In-N-Out has been letting its fans down by failing to serve anything that would satisfy a burger-loving customer who wants a healthy, humane, and sustainable option.</td><td>0</td><td>1000</td></tr><tr> <td>6</td> <td>Save Koalas from dissapearance!!</td> <td>anonymous</td> <td>Koalas will soon dissapear if we don't do anything about this, we must act now!!</td><td>0</td><td>1000</td></tr><tr> <td>7</td> <td>Race against cancer</td> <td>George Huzum</td> <td>We need to take action now !</td><td>0</td><td>30000</td></tr><tr> <td>8</td> <td>test1</td> <td>George Huzum</td> <td>test1</td><td>0</td><td>300</td></tr><tr> <td>9</td> <td>titletest</td> <td>George Huzum</td> <td>descriptiontest</td><td>0</td><td>300</td></tr><tr> <td>10</td> <td>pettest1</td> <td>George Huzum</td> <td>descriptiontest</td><td>0</td><td>3000</td></tr><tr> <td>11</td> <td>Save my people man!</td> <td>Michael Jordan</td> <td>Help everyone now!!!</td><td>0</td><td>3000</td></tr><tr> <td>12</td> <td>testandrei</td> <td>andrei voinea</td> <td>save the world</td><td>1</td><td>3000</td></tr><tr> <td>13</td> <td>Salvati Rosia Montana!</td> <td>Cristian Nicusor</td> <td>Salvati Rosia Montana!
